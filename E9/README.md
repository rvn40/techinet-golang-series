# Go Labs(Ngoprek): Constant

In this session, we will explore the concept of constant data types in Go. This docs aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of constants, which are immutable values defined at compile time. Constants play a vital role in ensuring the consistency and predictability of values throughout the program.

This documentation provides detailed examples and explanations to facilitate your learning experience. By the end of this docs, you will have a solid grasp of how to implement and leverage constants in your Go programs to achieve robust and efficient code.
