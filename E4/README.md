# Go Labs(Ngoprek): Comments

Comments are a common way to write any explanations/descriptions about a block of code, or they can also be used to mark code. Comments will be ignored when compiling or executing the program.

There are two types of comment in GO, which are inline and multiline comment. 

## Comments

Writing this type of comment begins with a double slash (//) followed by the comment message. Inline comments only apply to a single line of the message. If the comment message is more than one line, then the double slash (//) must be written again on the next line.

Here is the example of inline comments:
```
// Line for import a package
// It is represented by "import" keyword
import "fmt"
```

And this is the example of multiline comments:
```
/* 
  Line for import a package
  It is represented by "import" keyword
/*
import "fmt"
```

You can see the differences between those example. The purpose remainly same but depend of the occasion you have to choose one of the most efficient ways among them.
